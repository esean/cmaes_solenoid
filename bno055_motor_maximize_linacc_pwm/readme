# Build:

	$ ./build.sh

# Usage:

	bno055_motor_maximize_linacc_pwm [each candidate test time] [0|1]

	* The program will sample each lamda candidate for [test time] and average
	  the linear acceleration samples it reads from the accelerometer. This
	  averaged value is the 'fitness' of each 2D (x[0],x[1]) sample point.
	  
	  The x[0],x[1] values are the PWM frequency and duty cycle set to the motor/
	  solenoid. The program will attempt to find that 2D combination that gives
	  either a max or minimum linear acceleration.
	
# Run:

	#	find minimum:
	$ ./bno055_motor_maximize_linacc_pwm 0.1 0

	#	find maximum:
	$ ./bno055_motor_maximize_linacc_pwm 0.1 1
